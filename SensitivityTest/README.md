The sensitivity test is conducted to estimate the uncertainty of different model parameters on the model results. I selected 14 model parameters, which are neither examined by the sensitivty analysis (i.e., the thermal traits) nor the sensitivty run (i.e., the lake mixing parameters). 
For these 14 parameters, I tested ±25% the default parameter values and examined the changes in the model results, i.e., total nutrient concentration (μM P), community biomass of phytoplankton and zooplankton (μM P), and community-weighted mean phytoplankton biovolume (μm3).

The script and results are attached in this folder. More details can be found in the related publication of this work (See front page).
