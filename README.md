# TempSizeMod - Temperature-size Model

The effects of temperature on phytoplankton community is highly important under global environmental change and climate warming. Nevertheless, untangling the effects of temperature on phytoplankotn is not easy because temperature often interacts with other environmental factors that contribute to various feedbacks to the phytoplankton community, making predictions on community dynamics difficult.

However, climate warming is increasingly threatening ecosystem and the organisms living in it, of which the phytoplankton is one of the groups at the forefront from rising water temperautures. It has already been observed that temperature change has led to alterations in the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton (i.e. phenological shifts), the community composition and even trophic structure. It is therefore crucial to disntangle the major factors that drive assembly and dynamics of the phytoplankton community.

Trait-based models of phytoplankton community have been applied to investigate the effects of environmental conditions on their population dynamics because it allows explorations on aggregate group properties such as total biomass, community mean cell size, and size variances, hence is useful for understanding changes in macroecological pattern of the phytoplankton population.
