# Thermal regulation on phytoplankton growth
In this exercise we focus on comparing the different mechanisms from temperature regulation on cell growth of phytoplankton.
The growth of phytoplankton community increases exponentially with temperature (Eppley, 1972).
As growth rates reduce with increasing phytoplankton sizes due to metabolic constraints (Peters, 1983; Brown, 2004; Litchman and Klausmeier, 2004), a higher temperature can exacerbate the stronger growth of the smaller phytoplankton, and these smaller phytoplankton can still grow better in lower temperature (Kingsolver, 2009).
Because small phytoplankton can also uptake nutrient more efficiently when nutrient level is low (Chrisholm, 1992), assuming an identical ability in competing for light, small phytoplankton will always dominate until zooplankton grazer appear.
Zooplankton that appears first are smaller in body size, as they assimilate energy better than the large one. These smaller zooplankton grazer tend to consume these smaller cells more intensively, possibly because it is easier to handle and can ingest more of these smaller cells , than the larger cells, within a certain amount of time.

Within a community, the temperature regulation can vary among different phytoplankton cell sizes (Kingsolver, 2009). 
More specifically than a community mean response to temperature, they exhibit sensitivity to a certain range of temperature.

### Exploration --
#### How community mean response in temperature regulation differ to community size-specific response in temperature regulation

We compare the different mechanism on temperature regulation using a lake model based on realistic environmental forcing, specifically,
1. Lake water surface temperature,
2. Photosynthetically-active radiation,
3. Mixed layer depth, and 
4. Nitrate concentration (expressed in nitrogen as the model currency).

We examine changes in the dynamics of the model variables with two indices, the total phytoplankton biomass and the phytoplankton mean size.
