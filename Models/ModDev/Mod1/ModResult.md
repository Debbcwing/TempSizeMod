The below results for phytoplankton biomass and phytoplankton mean size are based on a size-based NPsZsD lake model, with multiple phytoplankton size classes feeding two zooplankton size classes.

Several additional assumptions are:
  - thermal response of the phytoplankton follows a unimodal curve adapted from Norberg (2004)

  
  - the maximum growth of phytoplankton follows an allometric relationship taken from data compilations of Edwards et al. (2012)

  
  - phytoplankton nutrient uptake follows Michelis-Menton kinetics
  - the half-saturation constant of the uptake kinetics derived from a community mean value and is not size-dependent
  - nitrogen as model currency and nitrate as a single nutrient source for phytoplankton
  - phytoplankton are grazed by size-selective zooplankton, small phytoplankton are grazed more intensively
  - zooplankton graze on a wide size-feeding range; small zooplankton has a narrower range than large zooplankton in absolute values
  - zooplankton grazing responds to changes in temperature by a Q10 factor
